# Pomme: a cross-platform implementation of the Macintosh Toolbox C API

**Pomme** is a partial, cross-platform implementation of the Macintosh Toolbox C API. It is designed to ease the porting of 90's games written for MacOS 7-9 to modern operating systems. You can think of it as a cross-platform reimagining of Apple's own [Carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_(API)), albeit at a much reduced scope.

The goal isn't to achieve 100% source compatibility with old Mac C programs, but rather, to make it a bit easier to port them. I only intend to implement the bare minimum functionality required to keep a reasonable level of source code compatibility with the games I'm interested in porting.

This project originated in 2020 to aid in updating Pangea Software's [Nanosaur](https://github.com/jorio/Nanosaur) to run on modern operating systems.
